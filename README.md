# Fresh Pear CSS

## Credits
This CSS framework is an adaption of [Justin Marsan's MobileReadyFramework](https://github.com/justinmarsan/MobileReadyFramework)
We are using the [YAML CSS Framework](http://www.yaml.de/en/home.html) as a foundation for the layouts because it works great all the way down to IE6 and has a strong focus on accessibility. 
The creation of this and Justin's framework were triggered by a question [Kahlil posted on Forrst](http://forr.st/~gj4).
